Compilation of Machine Learning Projects

----------------------------
F1 Race Predictor
----------------------------
* Project Description: XGBoost algorithm that predicts the outcome of Formula 1 races using historical data. The model takes into account various factors such as lap times, pit stops, driver points, and more, to give an informed prediction on the race outcome.

* Installation and Usage: Use google colab and import the datasets into the colab environment. Once the data is loaded, run the terminal. The files are below:
- races.csv
- drivers.csv
- constructors.csv
- constructor_results.csv
- lap_times.csv
- status.csv
- driver_standings.csv
- pit_stops.csv
- qualifying.csv
- circuits.csv

* Technologies Used: Scikit-learn, pandas, numpy and matplotlib.

----------------------------
Genetic_Algorithm_2D_Pygame
----------------------------
* Project Description: Game that simulates the evolution of computerised organisms using a Genetic Algorithm. Organisms will initially  act randomly and progressively work together to move to a target through the application of natural selection.

* Installation and Usage: Need to install Pygame and provide pictures for sprites.
  
* Technologies Used: pygame, pandas, numpy and matplotlib.

----------------------------
LSTMStockPriceForecasting
----------------------------
* Project Description: This project forecasts stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks. It utilises historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance, trains LSTM models, and evaluates their performance. The project offers insights into predicting future stock prices, aiding investors in making informed decisions.

* Installation and Usage: Need to install the packages in the bullet point below. Modify the stock_list variable in the main function to include the desired stock tickers. Adjust the configuration parameters in the main function, such as start date, end date, window, early termination, and dependent variable.
  
* Technologies Used: numpy, pandas, tensorflow, matplotlib, re, pandas_datareader, datetime, yfinance, os, scikit-learn

--------------------------------
K_Means_and_K_medians_algorithm
--------------------------------
* Project Description: Clustering algorithms with B-Cubed evaluation on a word embedded dataset (includes ground truth labels).

* Installation and Usage: Run in terminal or notebook.
  
* Technologies Used: pandas, numpy and matplotlib.

---------------------------------------
Simple Multi Layer Perceptron
---------------------------------------
* Project Description: Multi Layer Perceptron with self made backpropagration incorporating gradient descent.

* Installation and Usage: Run in terminal or notebook.
  
* Technologies Used: pandas, numpy and matplotlib.

---------------------------------------
Perceptron_algorithm_2d_3d_4d
---------------------------------------
* Project Description: Visual representation of simple perceptron model in 3 different dimensions. Script shows how hyperparameter of the model changes as the algorithm is trained.

* Installation and Usage: Run in terminal or notebook.
  
* Technologies Used: pandas, numpy and matplotlib.
